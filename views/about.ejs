    <h1>About <%=fitnessData.appName%></h1>
    <p>FitTrack is a lightweight fitness application that helps users record and manage their daily training. Users can create an account and log in to the system, add their own training records, including the training date, title, notes, and specific exercise items. Each training item can be filled with information such as the action name, sets, repetitions, and weight, making it convenient for users to track their training progress over time. The application provides a training list page and a training details page, allowing users to view all their past training. At the same time, the system supports searching for training records by action name and date range, helping users quickly find specific content. All data is securely stored in the database and can be accessed through the web at any time. The goal of FitTrack is to enable users to record their training, view history, and maintain healthy habits in the simplest way.!</p>
